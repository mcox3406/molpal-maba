Using this directory as the current working directory, try running:

```bash
molpal run --config configs/sample_config.ini
```

If everything was installed properly (see the [root README file](/README.md)), this should run quickly (<5 mins) and create a results directory `test-mpn-run/` that contains the output files. Don't worry too much about the data itself; this is only for testing that MolPAL and pyscreener are installed correctly.
